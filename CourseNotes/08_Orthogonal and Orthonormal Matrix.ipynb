    "# Orthogonal Matrix - Detailed Understanding on Orthogonal and Orthonormal Second Order Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a deep dive into the concepts of orthogonal and orthonormal second-order matrices. By the end of this notebook, you'll understand what these terms mean, their significance in data science, and see them in action with some clear examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra and data science, the concept of orthogonality is fundamental. This idea extends to matrices, where we encounter terms like orthogonal and orthonormal matrices. A second-order matrix, also known as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, has two rows and two columns. Let's delve into the definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orthogonal Matrix**: A square matrix $A$ is orthogonal if its transpose $A^T$ is also its inverse $A^{-1}$. This means:\n",
    "$A^T A = AA^T = I$\n",
    "Where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthonormal Matrix**: It's a special kind of orthogonal matrix where the columns (or rows) are not just orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other but also have unit length. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this means:\n",
    "$ \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a & b \\\\\n",
    "c & d \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns $[a, c]^T$ and $[b, d]^T$ are orthogonal and their norms (lengths) are both equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Orthogonal matrices have some beautiful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their eigenvalues have a magnitude of 1.\n",
    "- They preserve the length of vectors when used for transformations.\n",
    "- The determinant of an orthogonal matrix is always +1 or -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties have found numerous applications in data science, such as in principal component analysis (PCA), QR decomposition, and some algorithms in machine learning."
