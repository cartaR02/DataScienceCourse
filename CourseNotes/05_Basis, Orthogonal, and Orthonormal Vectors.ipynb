    "# Vectors Linear Algebra - A Comprehensive Guide on Basis, Orthogonal, and Orthonormal Vectors with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are a foundational concept in linear algebra and have broad applications across the sciences. Among the most fundamental ideas related to vectors are the concepts of basis, orthogonality, and orthonormality. Let's take a closer look at each of these ideas with examples to deepen our understanding.\n",

    "## 1. Basis Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, a set of vectors is considered a basis for a vector space if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **They are linearly independent**: No vector can be represented as a linear combination of the other vectors.\n",
    "- **They span the space**: Any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Science Context**: When dealing with datasets, you can think of each data point as a vector in some space. Basis vectors can serve as a \"coordinate system\" for this space. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular dimensionality reduction technique, essentially tries to find a new basis for representing data where each basis vector (or principal component) captures a decreasing amount of variance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Suppose you have data points in 3D space, and you want to represent them in 2D without much loss of information. PCA will find two basis vectors (the first two principal components) that capture the most variance, allowing you to project your data onto these vectors and move from 3D to 2D.\n",

    "\n",
    "$ e2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0, 1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors are a basis for $R^{2}$ because any vector in $R^{2}$ can be written as a combination of **e1** and **e2**."

    "Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. This means they are perpendicular to each other in geometric terms.\n",

    "**Data Science Context**: Orthogonality is valuable in data science because orthogonal features (or vectors) are uncorrelated. This property is especially useful in regression analysis, where multicollinearity (correlation among predictor variables) can distort results and interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
